# Testing Rules

- Keep tests close to the code they test (see [*.test.ts, *.test.tsx](mdc:src)).
- Use descriptive test names in all test files.
- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes before committing.
- Test both success and error cases.
- Mock external dependencies and side effects.
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in tests.
- Ensure test coverage for critical paths.

## Test Requirements for New Features
- Unit tests for individual components and functions
- Integration tests for feature interactions
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance considerations where relevant

## Test Requirements for Bug Fixes
- Test that reproduces the bug
- Test that verifies the fix
- Additional tests for related edge cases
- Regression tests to prevent future issues
