# Git Workflow Rules

- Before committing any changes:
  1. Always run `git status` to check for all modified files
  2. Review the list of modified files to ensure all related changes are included
  3. Stage all related files together using `git add`
  4. Verify the staged changes with `git status` again
  5. Commit with an appropriate message following the commit message rules

- When making changes that affect multiple files:
  - Check `git status` before and after making changes
  - Ensure all related files are staged together
  - Do not commit partial changes that are logically related

- When working with dependencies:
  - Always check `git status` to ensure both `package.json` and lock files are included
  - Verify that no unintended files are staged

- When fixing issues or implementing features:
  - Check `git status` to identify all affected files
  - Include all related configuration, test, and documentation changes in the same commit
