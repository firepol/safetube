# Code Quality Rules

## File Structure
- Keep related files close together in the directory structure (see [src/](mdc:src)).
- Use clear, descriptive file names for all TypeScript files in [src/](mdc:src).
- Group related components in the same directory under [src/components/](mdc:src/components).

## Component Organization
- Only one React component per file in [src/components/](mdc:src/components).
- Place shared types in [src/types/](mdc:src/types).

## Documentation Standards
- Document complex functions with JSDoc in all [*.ts, *.tsx](mdc:src) files.
- Add comments for complex logic in [src/**/*.tsx](mdc:src) files.
