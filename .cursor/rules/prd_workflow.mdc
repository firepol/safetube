# PRD Workflow Rules

- The [docs/development-tracking.md](mdc:docs/development-tracking.md) document must be updated whenever a feature status changes.
- PRDs must be developed in the order specified in [docs/development-tracking.md](mdc:docs/development-tracking.md).
- Each PRD in [docs/prds/](mdc:docs/prds) must be completed before moving to the next one.
- Feature dependencies must be respected in the development order as tracked in [docs/development-tracking.md](mdc:docs/development-tracking.md).
