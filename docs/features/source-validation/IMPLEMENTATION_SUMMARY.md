## Key Files Modified/Created

### Main Process
- `/src/main/services/ipcHandlerRegistry.ts` - Added IPC handlers for validation and admin controls
- `/src/main/index.ts` - Enhanced WindowOpenHandler for channel validation

### Renderer Process
- `/src/renderer/services/sourceValidationService.ts` - Core validation service
- `/src/renderer/services/favoritesService.ts` - Updated for sourceId validation
- `/src/renderer/components/video/VideoCardBase.tsx` - Added unavailability states
- `/src/renderer/components/video/FavoriteButton.tsx` - Updated for sourceId
- `/src/renderer/components/layout/VideoGrid.tsx` - Integrated validation
- `/src/renderer/pages/AdminPage.tsx` - Added YouTube click control setting

### Shared Types
- `/src/shared/types.ts` - Enhanced interfaces with sourceId and channelId

### Preload
- `/src/preload/index.ts` - Exposed new IPC handlers

### Tests
- `/src/renderer/services/__tests__/sourceValidationService.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite (40+ tests)

### Documentation
- `/docs/features/source-validation/requirements.md` - Feature requirements
- `/docs/features/source-validation/design.md` - Technical design
- `/docs/features/source-validation/tasks.md` - Implementation tasks
- `/docs/features/source-validation/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Validation Service Pattern**
   - Centralized validation logic in SourceValidationService
   - Batch processing for performance
   - In-memory caching to minimize IPC calls

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Required sourceId field on all favorites
   - Validation at IPC handler level
   - Graceful handling of legacy data

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Batch validation: load sources once, validate all videos
   - Cache with 5-minute TTL
   - Stale-while-revalidate for better UX

4. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Fail-open for source validation (better UX)
   - Fail-closed for channel approval (better security)
   - Comprehensive error logging

5. **Security**
   - Settings stored in main process
   - IPC message validation
   - No renderer bypass possible
