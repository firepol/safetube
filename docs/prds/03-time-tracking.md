# Time Tracking PRD

## Overview
The Time Tracking feature manages and enforces daily viewing time limits for children, with persistent storage of usage data and automatic enforcement of limits across different video sources.

## User Stories
- As a parent, I want to set different time limits for each day of the week
- As a parent, I want to know how much time my child has spent watching videos
- As a child, I want to know how much time I have left to watch videos
- As a parent, I want the app to automatically stop videos when time limit is reached

## Success Criteria
- Time limits are properly enforced per day
- Usage data is accurately tracked and persisted
- Time remaining is clearly displayed
- Videos stop automatically when limit is reached
- Time tracking survives app crashes/restarts
- Different limits work correctly for different days
- Usage history is maintained accurately

## Technical Requirements
- JSON-based time limit configuration
- Persistent storage of usage data
- Real-time time tracking
- Crash recovery mechanism
- Time synchronization between main and renderer processes
- Data validation and error handling
- Backup mechanism for usage data

## UI/UX Requirements
- Clear display of time remaining
- Visual warning when time is running low
- Smooth transition when time limit is reached
- Easy-to-read time format
- Non-intrusive time display
- Clear messaging when time limit is reached

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for time tracking logic
- Integration tests for limit enforcement
- E2E tests for time tracking scenarios
- Crash recovery testing
- Data persistence testing
- Cross-day transition testing
- Edge case testing (timezone changes, etc.)

## Documentation Requirements
- Time limit configuration guide
- Usage data format documentation
- Time tracking implementation details
- Recovery mechanism documentation
- Troubleshooting guide for time tracking issues
