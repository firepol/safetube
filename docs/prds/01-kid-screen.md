# Kid Screen PRD

## Overview
The Kid Screen is the main interface where children can browse and watch whitelisted videos. It features a YouTube-like layout with horizontal sections for different video sources and categories.

## User Stories
- As a child, I want to see my last watched video at the top so I can continue watching it
- As a child, I want to see videos grouped by source (channels, playlists, folders) so I can easily find what I want to watch
- As a child, I want to distinguish between watched and unwatched videos so I know what's new
- As a parent, I want my child to only see whitelisted content so they stay safe

## Success Criteria
- All whitelisted video sources are displayed in their respective sections
- Last watched video appears at the top if available
