# Git Workflow PRD

## Overview
Implement a Git workflow that automatically runs tests on each push to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. The workflow will use a custom Docker image containing Node.js and yt-dlp to support the project's testing requirements.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want tests to run automatically on each push so that I can catch issues early
- As a maintainer, I want a reliable CI/CD pipeline so that I can trust the codebase quality
- As a contributor, I want clear feedback on test failures so that I can fix issues quickly

## Success Criteria
- Tests run automatically on every push to any branch
- Custom Docker image with Node.js and yt-dlp is available and working
- Test failures are clearly reported with actionable error messages
- Workflow completes within reasonable time (under 10 minutes)
- Integration tests that require video files are handled gracefully

## Technical Requirements
- GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- Custom Docker image with:
  - Node.js 18+ (latest LTS)
  - yt-dlp installed and available in PATH
  - Yarn package manager
  - Git for cloning repositories
- Test execution using `yarn test` command
- Proper handling of test failures and reporting
- Support for both unit and integration tests

## UI/UX Requirements
- Clear status indicators in GitHub pull requests
- Detailed test output in GitHub Actions logs
- Failure notifications with specific error details
- Success notifications when all tests pass

## Testing Requirements
- Workflow should run all existing tests (unit and integration)
- Handle gracefully tests that require video files not present in source control
- Provide clear error messages for missing dependencies
- Support for test timeouts and retries

## Documentation Requirements
- Workflow configuration documentation
- Docker image build and maintenance instructions
- Troubleshooting guide for common test failures
- Instructions for adding sample video files to source control

## Implementation Plan
1. Create Dockerfile for custom image with Node.js and yt-dlp
2. Set up GitHub Actions workflow configuration
3. Configure test execution with proper error handling
4. Add sample video files to source control for integration tests
5. Test and validate workflow functionality
6. Document setup and maintenance procedures

## Dependencies
- Project Setup (completed)
- Existing test suite (completed)
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Tests requiring video files will fail in CI
  - **Mitigation**: Add sample video files to source control or mock video access
- **Risk**: yt-dlp dependencies may change
  - **Mitigation**: Pin yt-dlp version and update regularly
- **Risk**: Docker image build failures
  - **Mitigation**: Use multi-stage builds and cache dependencies
