# Project Setup PRD

## Overview
Initial setup of the SafeTube application with Electron, React, and all necessary dependencies. This includes the basic project structure, build configuration, and development environment setup.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want a working development environment so I can start building features
- As a developer, I want a clear project structure so I can easily navigate the codebase
- As a developer, I want proper build and packaging configuration so I can distribute the app
- As a developer, I want hot reloading so I can develop efficiently

## Success Criteria
- Electron app launches successfully in development mode
- React components render properly within Electron
- Hot reloading works for both main and renderer processes
- Build process creates distributable packages
- All dependencies are properly configured
- Project structure follows best practices
- Development environment is reproducible

## Technical Requirements
- Node.js and npm/yarn setup
- Electron configuration
- React setup with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- shadcn/ui integration
- Build tools (Vite/Webpack)
- Development tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Git configuration
- Package scripts for development and building
