- **Blockers**: None
- **Dependencies**: Project Setup, Kid Screen
- **Progress**: 80%
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-04
- **Completed Items**:
  - Player page loads by video id and plays YouTube videos using embed
  - Navigation from homepage to player and back works

- **Remaining Items**:
  - Replace YouTube embed with a true HTML5 player (requires direct video stream URL)
  - Improve player design and controls
  - Add time tracking and resume support
  - Improve support for more DLNA formats (transcoding or proxy may be needed for full MKV/WEBM support)
- **Recent Changes**:

  - Two scripts exist for DLNA browsing: see `scripts/` for usage and documentation
  - Current design is functional but visually unpolished/ugly
  - Player page uses YouTube embed, not a true HTML5 player yet
  - To use an HTML5 player for YouTube, a direct video stream URL is needed (e.g., from yt-dlp)
