# SafeTube Development Tracking

This document tracks the development progress of SafeTube, a kid-friendly video player application. Each feature has its own PRD (Product Requirements Document) and status tracking.

## Development Guidelines

- [Cursor Rules](cursor-rules.md) - Guidelines for using Cursor IDE and maintaining code quality
- [PRD Rules](#prd-rules) - Requirements for feature documentation
- [Status Legend](#status-legend) - Feature status definitions
- [Sprint Planning](#sprint-planning) - Sprint organization guidelines

## Important Rules

### Date Management
- **ALWAYS check the current date before updating timestamps** using one of these methods:
  - Linux: `date` command
  - Node.js: `node -e "console.log(new Date().toISOString())"`
  - Or use the system's current date/time
- Never assume dates - always verify the current date before making timestamp updates
- This project started in June 2025, not 2024

### Changelog Generation
- Use the changelog script to get accurate development dates: `./scripts/generate-changelog.sh`
- The script generates a `changelog.txt` file with all commits grouped by date
- Use this changelog to update development tracking with correct dates
- Run the script before updating any timestamps in this document

## PRD Rules

Each feature PRD must include:

1. **Feature Overview**
   - Clear description of the feature
   - User stories
   - Success criteria

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Required components
   - Dependencies
   - Performance criteria

3. **UI/UX Requirements**
   - Wireframes/mockups
   - User flow
   - Accessibility requirements

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - User acceptance criteria

5. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Code documentation
   - User documentation
   - Configuration documentation
